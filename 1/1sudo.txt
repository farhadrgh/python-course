import random function
set step(s) 	to 1000000
set total(t)	to 0
set circle(c)	to 0

while total number of points is less than number of step
	set x coordinate of point to a random number between -1 and 1
	set y coordinate of point to a random number between -1 and 1
	set r (length of the point vector) to (x square + y square)
	if r is less than 1
		add one to c (circle)
	add one to t (total)
set p number to division of # of points in circle by # of point in total multiplied by 4
print p number
